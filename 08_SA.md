sudo su is a command used in linux to switch to root user, by granting the superuser privileges. 
Difference between sudo su and sudo su -
sudo su: This command switches you to the root user, but it doesn't create a new environment. It inherits your current user's environment varibales such as PATH, HOME and others. This means you will be using the root privileges but with the current users setting.
sudo su -: This command also switches you to the root user, but it starts a new shell session as if you logged in directly as the root user. This means you load the root users environment variable.
