#In this question first I created one group and then I tried to see it via ls commands and it was not visible so after serching I understood that it will be present in /etc directory. For adding user to the test group I went through the detailed informaiton about useradd command via man command.
after adding the user to the group, I created the password for user. After creating the user, I wasn't able to open user's home directory, I was getting a eroor and after searching I understood that user didn't had home directory, in some linux versions the home directory for user will be automatically created while in ubuntu we have to create it seperately. 
I also tried giving user the root privillages by editing the /etc/sudoers file with nanoeditor. Once I created the home directory for user and since I already gave the user permissions other tasks were easy. 
After that I checked which are permisisons cricket.txt file is having and according to the quesiton I made the changes. 
#chmod -R 750 nginx, using this command I am giving the user all the permissions, for group only read and write permissions and for others I am giving no permissions. 
Owner: Read (4) + Write (2) + Execute (1) = 7
Group: Read (4) + Execute (1) = 5
Others: No permissions (0)
#chown -R nginx:test nginx/
In this command I am changing the ownership of nginx directory. nginx user of test group is now the owner of all the files in that directory. 
#cj,pd g-w cricket.txt
using chmod commamd I am removing the write permission on cricket.txt file from group. 
whoami tells us the current user. 

Here I created the test.txt file in /home/nginx directory. As you can see here user and group has read, write permission while other has only write permission. Since file should be only writable by user, I am removing the write permission from the group, using chmod g-w. after this I have wrote the output of whoami to test.txt file.
