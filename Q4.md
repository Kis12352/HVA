root@kishori-virtual-machine:/var/log# last -s -5days -f auth.log

In the auth.log file, the logs are located and to see the last, -s flag stands for start time and -f stands for find. 

To find a file we can use this command, this commnad will look for auth.log file in current directory and sub directory. 
root@kishori-virtual-machine:/# find . -name auth.log

To find the type of a file we can use the following command, to display the file type without file name we can use -b flag. 
root@kishori-virtual-machine:/var/log# file auth.log
auth.log: ASCII text

To find the file name with extensio we will use following command,
root@kishori-virtual-machine:/# find /var/log -type f -name '*.log'
root@kishori-virtual-machine:/# find /var/log -type f -name '*auth.log'
/var/log/auth.log

We can find files by their type, size, permission and many other factors by giving the respective flag.
