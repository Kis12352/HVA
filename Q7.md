command to change multiple words with one word, here s is used for substitution, to seperte words I am using pipe and g is used to change all the occurrences of that word in a file, without g it will only replce the first occurence of that word.

#I first changed the permissions of the file hello.txt, then I added some content in that file using vi editor. Then I understood the sed command 
using man. To view the contents of the file I used cat command. -i flag stands for in place editing, it will directly edit the file, g stands for global it will replace all the occurunces of that particular word.
